# accelerometer-mma7660fc

This is a library to run the MMA7660FC accelerometer via the i2c bus.  It has tested on the BeagleBone Series, but it should also work for the Raspberry Pi.

Install:

```bash
npm install accelerometer-mma7660fc
```

Using it:

```javascript
var MMA7660FC = require('accelerometer-mma7660fc');

// The initialiser is the i2c bus number that the accelerometer is on.
var accelerometer = new MMA7660FC(2);

// Get the accelerometer values
accelerometer.getValues(function (err, values) {
    console.log(values);      // { x: '-24.95', y: '-13.55', z: '20.36' }
});
```
